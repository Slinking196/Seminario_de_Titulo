english,100% recommended,"Spectacular museum, they tell you all the functioning of La Esmeralda, giving a guided walk explaining each sector of the ship and its use, as well as where they slept, ate and did their activities the tribulation. As a child you are taught the history of Arturo Prat at school and to actually see how things happened in the same boat is very interesting, totally recommended. I recommend buying tickets online in advance so you don�t have to wait. We arrived 11.20 and just entered the museum with the 12.30 group. We take advantage of going to visit the Cathedral Church Immaculate Parish Conception Iquique in the meantime; and the square Condell which is like a walk through the center."

No doubt if you have the opportunity to go go because you will not regret it. As a data you must buy the entrance ticket in the garage what is next to the museum (all marked) and the tours of the museum are every few hours."
english,improve explanations of the Guide,the name guide Angel very friendly but very mechanical in a hurry and laconic.... only answered with monosyllables to the questions asked

english,From the recommended places in Iquique,"Excellent place to learn a little more about the history of Chile, very well decorated and the guides are polite and attentive to help"
english,Iquique must-see,"A must-see in Iquique, an impeccable place that replicates the Esmeralda very well. The guided tour is quick, but beneficial; well explained and illustrated with sound effects, steam and music the heroic deed. 100% recommendable."
english,Free great experience,"Everything well organized in the guided tour. Carlos the guide was a scuba diver so he put all the love into his story. Everything in order, groups Small, impeccable bathrooms� completely renovated."
english,A journey through history,"An excellent option to learn about part of Chile's naval history, a surprising tour. It is recommended to take the tour with a guide, for a very small surcharge on the entrance fee, but it is totally worth it."
english,Great visit,Great expeeience of a tall ship from the late 1800s. Very important in Chile's maritime naval history.  Ask for an english guidebook if no tours are available.
english,I slice of history worth visiting,"A  very important part of history which is worth visiting!   Unfortunately, all explanations along the well indicated tour is only in Spanish (not an uncommon here in Chile as for the tourism industry assumes its visitors only speak Spanish. Luckily, we did not hav an issue reading the explanations of the items we saw.   There were tour guides through the boat to assist however we were able to easily stump them with questions they did not know how to explain or answer.   They were quick to blamed the pandemic for being out of practice.  The price of admission was CLP$4,000 (USD$4,75) for adults and about 1/2 that for children / students.   The self guided tour takes about 40 minutes and its well worth it.   Parking near the boat is slim and given its neighborhood surroundings, I would suggested taking all with you to avoid a bad day.   The website says you need a reservation to visit, we called and was told that a reservation was not needed  (+56572530812)  Very glad we went!"
english,Great every time,"We visited this museum on a Saturday at 4:00 PM. I made the reservation online and it was the best thing, as I did not have to wait in line at all. This is a good museum as you get to know more about history in less than 1 hour. I recommend this place."
english,"Amazing, a piece of real history. A must see...","built few years ago, this replica museum is located less than a mile away from the real Esmeralda. A professional guide will take you through the daily life in the sailors back in 1879, and will show you how the Esmeralda works from the inside. You get to see everything inside, from the captain's private room to the bucket showers for the sailors. This tour will place you on the final hours before sinking, Captain Prat's Harangue, and the brave fight of all the heroes from the Combate Naval de Iquique ... A must ... thumbs UP. construido hace unos a�os, este museo r�plica se encuentra a menos de una milla de distancia de la verdadera Esmeralda. Un gu�a profesional lo guiar� a trav�s de la vida cotidiana de los marineros en 1879, y le mostrar� c�mo funciona la Esmeralda desde adentro. Puedes ver todo dentro, desde la habitaci�n privada del capit�n hasta las duchas para los marineros. Este recorrido lo ubicar� en las �ltimas horas antes de hundirse, La arenga del Capitan Prat, y la valiente lucha de todos los h�roes del Combate Naval de Iquique ... Una visita obligada ... aprobado."
english,Nice boat but the Tours are all in spanish,This is a nice ship and definitely worth the visit but the tours offered are all just in Spanish. There is no chance to visit the ship on your own. There is a small brochure offering some info in English but it is hard to read that while you are constantly talked to in Spanish and a woman is walking after the group making sure you follow and speed..
english,long lines in the summer,Well worth the visit. Very well done. Parking on the side streets. Go early to avoid the summer crowds. Wear a hat to walk around the area.
english,History,"If you like history or have interest in sailing ships then this is a good place to visit. The ship is seen through a guided group tour, details given at each major location of the ship (Spanish). Cost for foreigners is higher but by an inconsequential amount. I also received a booklet that details the ship and its history in English, though I don't know if that is normal procedure. Photos allowed without flash - ceilings are low of you're tall."
english,This is Chile's equivilent of the US's Alamo,Interesting presentation on the War of the Pacific and the heroic stand taken by Esmeralda's captain Auturo Prat and its crew  when heavily out matched and gunned.
english,Definitely worth a visit,"If you are remotely interested in history, this is a nice activity. Be warned: tix are limited so make a reservation online or come with a plan B. They start selling tix for PM tours at 13:50. You can�t buy onsite before that."
english,Increible,To walk through he esmeralda is to walk through history. This ship is an incredible recreation of the real one and the guides make you travel to the past. You can�t miss it!
english,Poorly managed attraction,"Over a four day long weekend in Iquique I wasnt able to visit the ship because I hadnt made reservations ahead of time. No possibility of waitlisting or visiting without a guide. Very reduced number of guided tours, with restricted group size, plus a ridiculous 2 hr lunch break means the actual max number of visitors per day is very low. Plus the attraction was closed on two of the days because of the holidays, which is crazy since this is the time when tourism peaks. Seemed like a nice ship but those in charge need to be more aware of demand. A lot of people were unable to visit. All in all very representative of the lack of quality in Chilean tourism in general."
english,Well done,This vessel tells a lot of the time when there where really seamen in the world. Entrance fee is very fair and good info all over. Sad I didnt have much time as the closed short after I came
english,Great History,Had a wonderful tour guide that spoke English and provided a very informative and interesting tour of the ship.
english,Nice replica museum,A very good replica museum worth rhe visit Nice giding vey well located A nice history lesson to visit
english,What an Amazing Museo,We visited the Museo Corbeta Esmeralda and we throughly enjoyed our tour. The tour guides were so kind and thoughtful by giving us literature in English. This Museo is an absolutely must see when in Iquique. Well worth the time and money. Well done Chile!!!
english,Cool Visit,"The ship has been extremely well maintained and the tour guide details almost everything and answers all questions. My guide did not speak English, so either bring a friend or just nod and smile during the tour if you don't speak Spanish."
english,"Rich history, excellent tour, impressive replica","The Spanish-language tour of the Esmeralda was fantastic; the guide was so knowledgeable and passionate that she made the history come to life and had us leaning in to get every part of every story. The tour exudes a lot of national pride, but just for the sheer depth of knowledge it is completely worth it. I didn't know anything about how these kinds of ships work so it was great to see from the inside and out what the mechanics are, and to learn about them in a historical perspective. The views from on top of the ship are great, too. Very thorough, very professional and I highly recommend!"
english,Museo Corbeta Esmeralda,"I was quite impressed with the quality and pace of the tour. Very interesting, in particular for a Chilean-born traveller like me. There were many facts about the 1879 war and facts and details surrounding life on board the ""Esmeralda"" and th 21 May 1879 battle. It is a must for all Chileans to learn the heroic feats of Captain Prat and his crew and officers. MigSydney"
english,Any True Pusser type would enjoy this Museo/Ship,This beautiful ship is a replica of the sunken corvette Esmeralda which was undaunted by the Peruvian iron ship during the Pacific War.  If you do not speak Spanish it is best to book ahead for an English guided tour.  Viewing this replica ... you would swear it was the original ... it took me back some 40+ years as a young naval officer cadet sailing on the East and West Coast of Canada.  An appropriately placed Naval Museo--- adjacent to the Ocean.
english,A symbol of chilean history,"Is an important place if you like history and ships. For most of chileans, and specially for the people of Iquique, this place is like the Arizona ship for americans (1941)."
english,Long waiting times,They only allow a certain number of people at a time and the wait is only worth it if you're into ships.
english,"MORE ENGLISH, GERMAN AND CHINESE INFO NEEDED","I believe good museums become excellent museums when they realize they should cater to as many different languages as they can. FRANKLY speaking I do not think the whole story is told about the Esmeralda and much more should be said about the  equally famous ironclad Huascar that sunk the Esmeralda, Cheers"
english,Very interesting,It's a very interesting museum where you can get to know a little bit of the lives on board some people had. A must go if you like history. ??
english,Best museum we have visited for a loooooong time.,"This replica of the real Esmaralda is perfectly made. Lots of details and looks very authentic. The guided tour gives a good understanding of the battle between the Peruvian and Chilean forces. The guide gave a lot of information on the ship, but also on the people working on the ship. There a few videos that explain details of some of rhe parts and there is sounds played all over the ship to make it fell like the ship is sailing etc."
english,Pleasant Tour (Wheelchair friendly),"Very interesting story behind this ship. Most people wonder why they mad a museum of a ship that was captured and destroyed, and it wasn't about that, but about a story of the courageous captain and men aboard. Make sure you call in advance to reserve, some days they only take reservations, sometimes not. You can not walk freely around the ship, it is a guided tour and the guide takes you room through room, explaining the different stories and facts about the ship. I did feel like more should have been explained, it was kind of left for the guest to ask questions to find out more. Oh, and a great plus, it is wheelchair friendly."
english,A place to go while you are in Iquique,"A very nice place to go for a two hours activity in Iquique. The ship is, of course, a replica of the original one, but it is very well achieved. The guide tour was really helpfull and with a lot of knowledge to share with visitors. The only problem with the place is there is little availability of parking, so you should be aware of that if you go by car. Kids love it and growns up aswell... at least I did!! :-)"
english,A bit disappointed,"Not exactly sure why this attraction is so highly rated, since I didn't believe it to be particularly interesting. I've been on several TallShips before and do not consider this one to be an outstanding gem amongst them. The tour was in Chilean (not Spanish) and, despite the guide being very friendly, enthusiastic and interesting, not easily understood... for a non-Chilean. Many parts are roped off, you can't really visit much of the ship and there's a guy walking behind making sure no one gets lost, or touches anything they shouldn't. A bit weird, this silent presence. Also, the ship sits in this pool between the fishing port docks and a busy, loud and smelly road. What was nice, was seeing sea lions swimming in the harbor between the small fishing boats."
english,One of the best museums in Chile,"To be honest, I wasn't too willing to visit this place before knowing it. After a 50-minutes tour that felt too short, I changed my mind. It is a faithful reproduction (i.e., it's a building, not a true ship) of the original Esmeralda ship that sank on the famous ""Combate naval de iquique"". Tour guides are knowledgeable and kind. During busy times (july, possibly january too) you have to make a reservation in advance because visiting groups are small (no more than 10 people). Leave your backpack/purse at the hotel (these are not allowed)."
english,Visit to museo  Corbeta Esmeralda,A guided tour of the museum was conducted by an experienced and knowledgable guide. A truly historical experience thanks to Matias.
english,Ease of access for all ability levels.,"Tours are in Spanish, but you if you don't speak Spanish you'll still be able to appreciate this site just. The tour took a little less than an hour and was a great experience. The ship is an extremely accurate copy of the second Esmeralda ship. You'll get to learn a little bit about the history of the ship and see what life was like on board. Overall the entrance fee was not too expensive, 2000 per adult. They had access for all ages, including access for people who can not do stairs. I'd recommend it if you enjoy history, naval battles, or just want to understand a bit more of Chilean culture."
english,Esmeralda 2015,"Had known of the Esmeralda for past 50 years, but never experienced being in the actual replica of the original, a history lesson I never imagined - worth the low cost of admission - would highly suggest you read up on Combate Naval de Iquique, 21-May-1879, THEN visit the ship to get a better sense of what it represents"
english,The best Iquique in-city activity,"If you are knowledgeable about Chile, you will know what a central place the Naval Battle of Iquique of the War of The Pacific has in Chilean and Peruvian history. An epic battle marked by the meeting of the old and the new. This museum replica of the Esmeralda, one of the Chilean ships involved in the battle, is true to life and to scale. One has to pre-arrange a tour of the ship by calling in the day before and registering over the phone. If you are Chilean, this is a must-visit. If you are a foreigner, its still a must, as one gets the full feel of what a 19th war barque was like, how it functioned and how its sailors and officers lived, fought and died."
english,A perfect copy,"A perfect copy of original ship, but a very long tour . The vessel is on the street , sorrounded by a pool . It may be attractive for young students, something the traveller will like.  Neighbourhood very dirty."
english,Bravo!,"A tremendously exciting story made all the more real by this amazing reconstruction of the original ship.  We booked our tour several days in advance to be sure of our appointment.  The guide had to be prompted to speak English, but after that he spoke quite faultless English.  There was a short film in Spanish as part of the tour.  There were plenty of opportunities for photos, and great views from the deck of Iquique harbour.  In the waiting area is an interactive display of knots used by sailors, which the kids enjoyed."
english,The Esmeralda,"I learnt about the Chilean history, the Pacific War of 1879. The guide was very knowledgeable and gave us many good stories of the people in the ship at the time of the war."
english,nice reconstruction,"The tours are in Spanish but if one knows a little of the history of the naval battle, you will enjoy this tour even if you don't  understand the tour. The original ship was sunk, so this is a reconstruction, with a nice collection of  nautical items which accurately portray the vessel in 1879."
english,Great for kids!,"My son dreams about pirates, so it was just right for him! visiting a 'real' big ship with cannons, kitchen, dining room, etc. You can even touch things! great for kids and to feel in the 19th century."
english,"It is a ""must"" when you visit Iquique.","High fidelity to the original ship, excellent guided visit, very high level of historical information. It is not expensive, but you should pay and make a reservation in the morning (9:45 AM) of the same day."
spanish,"Bonito, pero apresurado","Es una muy bella reproducci�n de la corbeta. Tomamos un tour guiado porque s�lo a trav�s de ella tienes acceso al castillo. El recorrido se hace demasiado r�pido, no se alcanza a disfrutar tranquilamente lo que se ve... al parecer el concepto es: s�base, tome fotos, v�yase. Sin duda es un trabajo muy bien hecho y esta,  adem�s,  bien cuidado.  F�cil de llegar."
spanish,Muy lindo museo patrimonio historico,"Bello y muy bien cuidado museo historico patrimonio de la ciudad. Replica tama�o real, cuenta fielmente como era la vida en el mar en esa epoca"
spanish,Imperdible,"Bonita experiencia, ideal para ir con los ni�os ya que permite revivir la �poca y la historia. Todo muy bien cuidado. Gran panorama en Iquique"
spanish,Muy bonito pero como atractivo tur�stico internacional deber�a ofrecer algunas cosas mas,"Soy Peruano y me parecio bastante interesante el museo y el barco, sin embargo la historia de los sucesos acaecidos el 21 de Mayo no me parecieron tan ciertos con respecto a la historia que a mi me ense�aron, pero lo recomiendo, muy bien conservado, limpio y ordenado, en un lugar ascequible"
spanish,Interesante Museo Hist�rico de la Guerra del Pac�fico.,"Siempre es bueno recordar este hecho hist�rico de Chile, la epopeya del Combate Naval de Iquique el 21 de mayo de 1879, entre embarcaciones de Chile y Per�, en la Guerra del Pac�fico. El testimonio m�s doloroso de esta derrota chilena es el hundimiento de la Corbeta Esmeralda la que se encuentra en el mar cercana a este museo con una hermosa r�plica de esta nave. Muy interesante, gran valor educativo para estudiantes y mayores. Entrada general $2.500. En estos tiempos de pandemia, la administraci�n procura controlar la distancia f�sica,  temperatura y uso de alcohol gel de los visitantes.  Tiempo de recorrido aproximadamente 40 minutos (autogu�a, s�lo asistencia en algunos puntos)."
spanish,Interesante,"Lugar imperdible que cuenta parte de nuestra historia, vale la pena  visitarlo. Est� ambientado a la �poca lo que hace m�s interesante representarse c�mo era la vida abordo."
spanish,Hermosa R�plica a escala 1 a 1,Hermoso replica  construida casi de la misma forma que la Esmeralda hundida en la rada de Iquique (se modificaron algunas cosas para facilitar la movilidad de los visitantes). Se puede ver como era la vida de los marineros de la �poca y permite comprender a�n mejor la valent�a de quienes enfrentaron al Hu�scar desde esta nave.
spanish,Me gusto,"Me gusto, todo muy claro, bien se�alizado, te dan todas las instrucciones al principio. El lugar es bien bonito, cuenta con todo lo que deber�a haber tenido la esmeralda. En estos momentos por pandemia est�n sin visita guiada. El recorrido te toma 30 a 40 minutos."
spanish,Me encanta,"Lugar de turismo,  algo muy importante de la zona con historia y foto imperdible , si visitas ahi tengo fotos con mis hijos la verdad es que adoro iquique"
spanish,"Interesante, muy bonito, limpio. La historia guardada en ese velero.","Esta era la segunda vez que est�bamos en la ciudad de Iquique al norte de Chile. La primera vez fue en enero de 2018, cuando, mi esposa y quien suscribe, hicimos nuestro primer viaje por Sudam�rica, en nuestra camioneta, con el objetivo de bajar desde Quito, Ecuador (donde residimos), hasta llegar a Ushuaia en la Tierra del Fuego Argentina. Esta segunda oportunidad pretend�amos hacer algo similar, pero con algunas variantes para conocer otros sitios que no pudimos en aquel primer viaje. Una de esas actividades pendientes, en Iquique era, justamente, la visita al Museo Corbeta Esmeralda. Informaci�n sobre �ste atractivo, hay mucho en internet y otras p�ginas tur�sticas, as� es que creo que ser� suficiente decir que s� vale la pena visitar �sta r�plica similar a la  nave del siglo XIX que combati� en varias guerras mar�timas y que fue hundido en el combate naval de Iquique. Vale decir que siendo una r�plica, est� muy bien construida para el fin tur�stico e hist�rico que se persigue, muy limpio, ordenado y conservado, ofreciendo una excelente ambientaci�n de lo que debi� ser aquella embarcaci�n en sus a�os de servicio. Los tours que se ofrecen est�n excelentemente organizados y guiados por personal bien preparado. El costo de la entrada es moderado, pudiendo, adem�s, en los exteriores del sitio, comprar peque�os recuerdos y souvenirs para llevarlos a casa."
spanish,hermosa r�plica,"Nos encant�, todo muy bien cuidado, ordenado, de verdad un excelente panorama para quienes disfrutamos de la historia y amamos nuestro pa�s."
spanish,Historia,"Es un hermoso recorrido lleno de historia, donde se encuentra la vida de nuestro mayor heroe Arturo Prat, donde se muestra la arenga que realizo; principalmente cada vez que la escucho me emociono."
spanish,reclamo,mas omenos creo que antes era mucho mejor cuanto no avia rejas y podias sacarte fotos libremente ahora solo intentan lucrar con ese barco que creo que no es de nadie sino del estado de chile???? y nose deberia lucrar con eso
spanish,Imperdible hist�rico,"Es una representaci�n a escala real de la corbeta chilena Esmeralda, hundida en el combate naval de Iquique ocurrido en 1879. Est� muy bien cuidado y puedes acceder a un recorrido guiado donde puedes conocer detalles de c�mo viv�an en esa �poca los hombres de mar. �Excelente!"
spanish,Extraordinaria recreaci�n del buque esmerando de 20 de mayo de 1879,Creo que es extraordinario lo hecho por fundaci�n Coyahuasi en este caso. Impresionante la reacreaci�n con todos los detalles. Las guias muy bien preparadas con todos los detalles. Es una visista forzada
spanish,Un encuentro con la nostalgia,Resulta conmovedor ver y sentir como convivian en reducido espacio tantos hombres de mar. Es un bonito tour que no es caro y no te tomsr� mucho tiempo.
spanish,Museo que deben conocer,"Ayuda a entender la magnitud de la proeza de almirantes y marinos en esa �poca. Dan tiempo suficiente para tomar lindas fotos. Vayan con tiempo, porque hay que esperar turno. Hay grupos cada diez minutos, pero son peque�os, 12 personas. El recorrido dura 50 minutos. No es cara la entrada."
spanish,Tour guiado a Corbeta Esmeralda,"Muy buena atenci�n, fui con adulta mayor (88 a�os) y nos facilitaron silla ruedas para facilidad de movimiento. Ayuda en las subidas y bajadas de escaleras con silla-ascensor e incluso nos adelantaron 40 minutos la cita que hab�amos reservado. El tour muy bueno, es muy interesante recorrer todo esto con la historia, las explicaciones, etc. Muy recomendable."
spanish,Un imperdible!,"El museo es muy bonito, bien cuidado y la gu�a explica de manera clara la historia del barco y de los tripulantes. Super recomendado."
spanish,Museo Historico,"replica dela corbeta de madera  original que combati� con un blindado, hasta dispara el ultimo ca�onazo y se hundi� sin rendirse. Se hizo epica por la epopeya de Arturo Prat y su tripulacion.. Visita obligada y para recordar para siempre}"
spanish,Visita obligada en Iquique.,Visita imperdible si visitas Iquique! Ideal reservar en l�nea en su p�gina web. Muy recomendable para revivir momentos previos la Combate Naval de Iquique.
spanish,Muy interesante,"El recorrido cuenta con un gu�a que va contando la historia y explicando lo que se muestra en el museo. Esta muy bien hecho, se mantiene en buen estado. Los gu�as est�n muy bien informados sobre el tema y responden preguntas. Se recomienda no ir con mochilas o bolsos grandes. De todos modos el lugar cuenta con lockers para dejar las pertenencias."
spanish,Maravillosa experiencia,"Uno se transporta a esa �poca, es una suerte poder conocer c�mo era la Esmeralda verdadera.  El gu�a va explicando y mostrando todo de manera amena.  Al no estar en el mar no se mueve (para quienes se marean), en su interior tienen parlantes en los que se escucha el sonido del mar, aves, etc."
spanish,Buen museo!,"Es una excelente opci�n para recordar la historia y aprender sobre el barco la esmeralda, adem�s de c�mo se viv�a en aquellos tiempo. Los gu�as te explican todo con detalle y no dura m�s de 1 hora."
spanish,Viaj� al pasado Esmeralda,"Vale la pena ,vivir la historia y fomentar la cultura a trav�s de esta visita muy bonito y educativo precio razonable , se reserva horario en l�nea con gu�a y una vista inigualable"
spanish,Si vas a Iquique TIENES que visitar la Esmeralda,"El museo es muy bello, es una r�plica del barco original. Solo se puede entrar con tour y dura 45 minutos. Se puede reservar online o por tel�fono el horario de visita, realmente es un imperdible."
spanish,Excelente experiencia!,"Muy lindo lugar, aprend� mucho sobre la batalla Naval de Iquique. Tuvimos suerte, ya que llegamos y pudimos entrar de inmediato, las personas que trabajan ah� son muy cordiales..."
spanish,Buena visita guiada,"Me encant� la visita, cambiar�a ciertos aspectos quiz�s en las recomendaciones a los visitantes, ya que hab�an personas que por tomarse fotos retrasaban la gu�a y eran un poco irrespetuosos con la historia de la corbeta. Fuera de eso, el gu�a muy preparado, consulta que hubo supo responderla muy bien."
spanish,Encuentro con la historia,"Es una r�plica de la original corneta Esmeralda de el hist�rico 21 de Mayo del cual hay trajes y armas de la �poca se reprodujeron las armas uniformes ,sala de m�quina tim�n, dormitorios y sala reuniones de la original, con videos simplificando la visita y gu�as tur�sticos que ayudan en todos por momento ,a continuar con la visita adem�s hay un actor que personifica a capitan Arturo Prat muy hist�rica experiencia."
